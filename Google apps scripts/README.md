# Google Apps Scripts for Google Sheets

Employer: Simply Interactive, Inc

What began as a simple spreadsheet, transformed into an automated production and asset managing suite.  From the moment we are aware of an impending new device until the final payment is received for the work, everything is tracked, dated, and identified with full version control (thank you Google).  This included production reporting of daily, weekly and monthly output rates by client and by employee.
