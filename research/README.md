# Research into Algorithms and Mathematical Theory
While looking for ways to improve my code's efficiency, I decided my knowledge of search and sort algorithms was too limited.  I embarked on a quest to compare and learn the best search and sort algorithms in PHP and their appropriate usages and limitations. These files are, more or less, the notes I took and tests I ran during that time.
