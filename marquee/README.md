# Scrolling Marquee
2015  
Employer: Simply Interactive, Inc

This was a fun project I was able to accomplish while at Simply Interactive Inc.  In conjunction with the massive upgrade I implemented for our production and asset management spreadsheet, we decided to put up a scrolling marquee in the office that detailed the production rates of the product capturers to motivate and encourage friendly competition.  The script was loaded on to a local server and set to run regulary via a CRON job.
