# Experience with Python
I have always been interested in web scraping and decided it was time to see what it was all about!  I came across [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) and it was exactly what I was looking for!  So, I got to work.  This was not my first time with Python, but it ended up being the most formative.  I enjoyed figuring out how to be more "Pythonic" and beginning to scratch the surface of what this iconic language can do.  

The file I have included is the spider I wrote for retrieving data from the website I was scraping using Scrapy via [Scrapinghub.com](http://scrapinghub.com/).
