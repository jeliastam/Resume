# Welcome!
Whether you have stumbled upon this repo or were specifically directed here, thanks for stopping by!  I am Jordan Eliastam and this is my resume repo.  I have some examples of older projects and code snippets and hope they will provide an adequate window in to my skills, experience and foundation in software development.

While I have always had an affinity for technology, it is not what defines me.  I spend most of my free time outdoors, either on a mountain bike or a snowboard.  I find challenges invigorating whether they be code-based or trail-based and love pushing myself beyond my current boundaries.
